       <p><mark>You ae so excited to be apart of this when you go into the show you jump into the portal, not waiting for any advice. You pop up out of the well on the other side.</mark></p>

       <p><mark>You climb out. You wander away looking at the scenery. All of a sudden you feel a sharp pain in your leg. You look down and see an arrow sticking out of your knee. You hear a yell. You try to run away but you can't because the pain is too bad. after falling to the floor someone comes up behind you. It's a villager who saw you come out of the well. He thinks your a demon, so he slashes your throat.</mark></p>

       <p><mark>You are now dead.</mark></p>
